# Log Analysis on EDGAR Log File Data Set

In this project, we use clustering algorithms to recognize log patterns in the EDGAR log files data set. By recognizing the log patterns from billions of logs, it will be faster to troubleshoot a slow performance issue and optimize logging pipelines to reduce operational costs.
