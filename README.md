# Log Analysis on EDGAR Log File Data Set

The goal of this project is to use clustering algorithms to recognize log patterns in the EDGAR log files data set. By recognizing general log patterns from billions of logs, companies can perform fast troubleshoot and optimize logging pipelines to reduce operational costs. 

**Challenges**

* Determine the appropriate optimization techniques to improve the clustering performance.
* Design scalable versions of the clustering and recognition modules.
