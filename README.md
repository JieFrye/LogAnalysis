# Log Analysis on EDGAR Log File Data Set

EDGAR log data set allows for the study of demand for financial disclosures filed with the SEC. Researchers intending to study investor attention need to screen out any programmatic, or “robot”, downloads so that the remaining observed page views correspond to human readers. 

The sheer size of the files presents big data challenges, and I intend to build an API with a method for counting human views in the EDGAR log file.
